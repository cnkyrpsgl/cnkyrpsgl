Cenkay is a self-motivated, self-taught, and easygoing person fascinated by technological trends & big ideas and always happy & exciting to be doing the next project.

When he learns a new language, he tries to absorb mostly used concepts. When it is a framework, he tries to get the most out of it by reading documentation. He likes to continue learning by doing side projects for solving a problem by using that technology. Loves to keep up with the community that he is using the technology and tries to be part of it.
As being one of the most passionate guy you will see in the industry, he literally lives and breaths computer science, technology, and entrepreneurship. In essence, his passion and joy along the journey brought him to industry. He is currently learning and growing with one of the biggest e-commerce brands of Turkey, Migros (Sanalmarket, Migros Hemen, Tazedirekt, Macrocenter). Thanks for reading Cenkay's intro.
